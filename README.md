## Results
###Due to posiible academic dishonesty the analysis was done twice. Once with the full set of student data and a second time, excluding scores from the Thomas High Scholl 9th graders. 
*The second analysis yielded the folowing results:
  *Overall passing percenteages at Thaoms High School went from 90 to 65%. Koncking Thoams High out of the top five schools.

  *Overall passing percentages at the the distrcit level were barley impacted.
 ###Budget compared to studnet scores

 ##Summary
 
 ###We discovered the following:
 *Removing the ninth graders scores from the analysis had a negative impact on the overall passing percentage at Thomas High School
 *School bugets had little impact on student performance
 *Students at larger schools have loxer scores than students at medium and small schools
 *Charter schools have higher scores than district schools.
 *Reading and Math scores were consistent accross all grades.
